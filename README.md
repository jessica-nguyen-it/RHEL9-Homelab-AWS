# RHEL 9 Homelab on AWS EC2 🐧🧠 

This homelab is where I test, break, fix, and learn everything I need for the RHCSA. I’m documenting my progress as a multi-part series, with each entry focused on a specific exam domain. I’ll be updating regularly as I work through new topics, break things (on purpose or not), and learn from the process. 

#### Now... with all that context out of the way, let’s get to what you're actually here for 😹
