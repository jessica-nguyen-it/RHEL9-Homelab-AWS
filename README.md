# RHEL 9 Homelab on VMware Workstation and AWS EC2 🐧

This homelab is where I test, break, fix, and learn everything I need for the RHCSA. I’m documenting my progress as a multi-part series, with each entry focused on a specific exam domain. I’ll be updating regularly as I work through new topics, break things (on purpose or not), and learn from the process. 

#### Now... with all that context out of the way, let’s get to what you're actually here for!


## First: the environments i'll be practicing on

#### Cloud Platform: AWS EC2
- **Instance Type:** t3.micro  
- **vCPU:** 2 vCPUs  
- **Memory:** 1 GiB RAM  
- **Storage:** 20 GiB root volume + two 5 GiB EBS volumes  
- **Operating System:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9  

#### Local Platform: VMware Workstation (3 VMs)
- **VM Specs:** 2 vCPUs, 2 GiB RAM each  
- **Storage:** 25 GiB virtual disk per VM  
- **Operating System:** Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (for consistency with cloud setup)


## Now for the fun part:

`NOTE: I upload logs in batches, so if it looks quiet, just know updates are always brewing behind the scenes!`
