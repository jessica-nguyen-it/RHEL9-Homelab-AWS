# RHEL 9 Homelab on VMware Workstation and AWS EC2 🐧

This homelab is where I test, break, fix, and learn everything I need for the RHCSA. I’m documenting my progress as a multi-part series, with each entry focused on a specific exam domain. I’ll be updating regularly as I work through new topics, break things (on purpose or not), and learn from the process. 

#### Now... with all that context out of the way, let’s get to what you're actually here for!


## First: the environments i'll be practicing in

1. AWS EC2 (Cloud, 1 VM)
   - for experince over the cloud
   - t3.micro, 2 vCPUs, 1 GiB RAM, 20 GiB root + 2×5 GiB EBS, RHEL 9
  
2. VMware Workstation (Local, 3 VMs)
   - a local solution that mimics the RHCSA test enviroment
   - 2 vCPUs, 2 GiB RAM each, 25 GiB disk each, RHEL 9
  
3. My personal computer
   - a ThinkPad P15s, running Fedora 43 (upstream to RHEL)
   - Special kudos here, I made tons of progress treating my machine like a practice server!
