# RHEL 9 Homelab on AWS EC2 🐧🧠 

This homelab is where I test, break, fix, and learn everything I need for the RHCSA—and whatever comes after. I’m documenting my progress as a multi-part series, with each entry focused on a specific exam domain. Expect screenshots, config snippets, and honest reflections from the terminal trenches. I’ll be updating regularly as I work through new topics, break things (on purpose or not), and learn from the process. 

#### Now... with all that context out of the way, let’s get to what you're actually here for 😹


## 🛠️ First things first: the environment

- **Platform**: AWS EC2  
- **Instance Type**: t3.micro  
- **vCPU**: 2 vCPUs 
- **Memory**: 1 GiB RAM

## 📚 Now for the fun part: the series breakdown!
