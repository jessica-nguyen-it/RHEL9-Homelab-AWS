# Week 2: Revisiting the Fundamentals and Exploring New Tools

I decided to set aside this week to reinforce my understanding of key tools and foundational topics. Even though it took a while to go through, Iâ€™m glad I went back to the basics. A lot of these tools were things Iâ€™d learned but never really applied, so they didnâ€™t stick. 

Thinking back to my time as an SRE, I remember so many instances where leveraging some of these concepts wouldâ€™ve made troubleshooting so much easier. 

Well... at least I know now! ðŸ˜…

#### Anyways, to keep things light (and leave room for the more fun stuff), hereâ€™s a quick list of what I reviewed:

- Linux security and access control fundamentals: account types, ACLs, privilege escalation, user management, and file ownership/permissions  
- System documentation tools: `--help`, man pages, `apropos`, `mandb`, `info`, and `/usr/share/doc`  
- Hard vs. soft links: how they work and their limitations  
- File search and content manipulation  
- Basic and extended regular expressions  
- Archiving and compression: packing/unpacking files  
- Redirecting input/output  
- File transfers: SCP and SFTP  

## New Territory: Tools I Hadnâ€™t Used Before ðŸ˜²
While most of this was a refresher, I came across a few topics I hadnâ€™t worked with yet. So, I decided to dig a little deeper into what each one does, how it works, and where it might come in handy. Hereâ€™s what I found:

### SUID, SGID, and Sticky Bit permissions  

These extra permission bits affect file execution and directory behavior. I practiced setting and removing them, and saw how they can streamline access or introduce risks if misconfigured. Basically:

- **SUID (4):** Lets a file run with the owner's privileges. Great for controlled elevation (terrible if misconfigured).
- **SGID (2):** Same idea, but for group privileges. On directories, it ensures new files inherit the group.
- **Sticky Bit (1):** On shared directories, it prevents users from deleting each otherâ€™s files. 

### File-level backup and sync with `rsync`

- This section is in progress! ðŸš§ 
<!-- Iâ€™d seen `rsync` used in scripts before, but hadnâ€™t tried it myself until now. Once I got hands-on, I understood why itâ€™s a go-to for file-level backups and sync. I tested syncing directories, preserving permissions, compressing data during transfer, and excluding files. Itâ€™s fast, flexible, and surprisingly intuitive. -->

### Full disk imaging with `dd`  

- This section is also in progress! ðŸš§ 
<!-- `dd` felt intimidating at first, but once I broke it down, it started to make sense. I used it to create and restore disk images, and learned how powerful it can be for cloning drives or recovering from system failures. Definitely a tool Iâ€™ll keep in my back pocket for more advanced backup workflows. -->
